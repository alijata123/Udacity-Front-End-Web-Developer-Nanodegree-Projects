Your response goes here!

* I learned that writing a good code, is important for those who reads it, so its look nice and    clean, and for the coder who writes it, so he can focus easier on working with the files.
  It also helped me to rembember again some formating styles, that i had forget.

* Everything was easy first, but after this review i think next time, i should be more careful, so i don't have to submit the project more than once. :D

* Nothing was difficult.

* I have just use my past experience on these problems solving.
